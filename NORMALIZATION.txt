Normalization changes applied

1. Merged admin and student credentials into a single users table
   - Added users(id, username, password, role)
   - Replaces the separate admins table and student auth columns

2. Extracted rooms into a rooms table
   - Added rooms(id, room_no, capacity)
   - students now reference rooms via room_id instead of storing room_no directly

3. Standardized complaint status values
   - Added complaint_statuses(id, name)
   - complaints now reference status_id instead of storing free-text status

4. Added relationship constraints and uniqueness
   - users.username UNIQUE
   - students.roll_no UNIQUE
   - foreign keys added for student/user, student/room, complaint/student, complaint/status
   - ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate
